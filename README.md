## Usage
Just place in your home directory
Or you can use the setup.sh script to create links (but I doubt you'll do that).
The `setup.sh` script will:
0. Exit if not running on MacBook
1. Set date/time format in menu bar    *(edit the script and change to your desired format)*
2. Set the login shell to `/bin/bash`  *(again, edit to your desired, e.g. '/bin/zsh')*
3. Install `Homebrew` and the packages listed in the Brewfile *(replace with your own)*
   (brew bundle [install]  # installs all found in Brewfile)
   (brew bundle dump       # create Brewfile)
4. Saves existing dot files to `$HOME/.orig`
5. Creates symlinks to all dot files found herein

In order to run it, you need to:
```
$ git --version   # if git not installed, should be prompted to install it
$ git clone https://github.com/pataraco/dot_files.git
$ vi setup.sh     # make desired changes: e.g. repo path, date/time format, login shell
$ bash setup.sh
```

### "Show Aliases" and "Show Functions"
After sourcing the .bash_aliases file, you'll get these useful aliases:
* `a`  - (list) aliases
* `f`  - (list) functions
* `sa` - show alias
* `sf` - show function

## AWS CLI Functions
Check out the sweet AWS CLI functions (they begin with "aws") in `.bash_aliases_aws`
and can be listed/seen with the following aliases:
* `af`  - (list) AWS functions
* `saf` - show AWS function

## Have Fun!
hope someone picks up some tricks from these!

-Later!
